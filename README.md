# multitube

MultiTube was a small project which would allow for users to create YouTube feeds separate from their subscription box. The users, ideally, would create different categories of channels. For example, a category for educational videos, one for skits, one for vlogs, and so on.

I made this becasue sometimes I would want to follow a channel, but not see every one of their videos. I also would binge watch a certain type of videos (mainly engineering and woodworking videos) and I wanted a place to easily do this.
